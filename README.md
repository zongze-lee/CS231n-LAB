# CS231n-LAB
This is the accompanying lab for Stanford University's computer vision course.

## assignment1
Assignment 1 in CS231n-LAB focuses on fundamental concepts in machine learning and neural networks. In this assignment, we implemented several key components:
- K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier for classification tasks.
- Fully connected layer for dense neural network architecture.
- Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) layer for introducing non-linearity.
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) layer for classification.
- Softmax layer for multiclass classification.
- Constructed a two-layer fully connected neural network for learning basic neural network principles.

## assignment2
Assignment 2 in CS231n-LAB delves into advanced topics in deep learning and neural network architectures. This assignment includes the implementation of the following techniques:
- Batch normalization layer, Layer normalization layer, Spatial-Batch normalization, Spatial-Group normalization layer for normalizing activations within features.
- Dropout layer for regularization and preventing overfitting.
- Convolutional layer for learning spatial hierarchies of features.
- Built a high-performance deep learning network using PyTorch framework, integrating the aforementioned techniques for optimal results.

## assignment3
Assignment 3 in CS231n-LAB explores feature extraction, adversarial examples, and advanced machine learning frameworks. This assignment involves the following tasks:
- Generated saliency maps, fooling images, and class visualizations to analyze network activations and vulnerabilities in neural networks.
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): Suitable for sequential data processing tasks such as natural language processing and time series analysis.
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): A type of RNN architecture with improved ability to capture long-range dependencies.
- Transformer: Known for its effectiveness in handling attention mechanisms and transformer-based architectures like BERT for language understanding tasks.
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN): Used for generating realistic data samples, such as images, by training a generator and discriminator network simultaneously.
- SimCLR (Contrastive Learning): Focuses on learning effective representations from unlabeled data using contrastive loss functions, enabling better generalization and transfer learning capabilities.
